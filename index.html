            <h1>Gavin Nelson | WDD 130</h1>
            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello. My name is Gavin Nelson.">
            <p>Howdy partners! My name is Gavin Christian Nelson (though I usually used the initials "Gavin C.N.") and I'm from the city of San Antonio, Texas. <strong>That's right!</strong> I live in the Lone Star State itself. It's actually quite lovely living here, not for the weather but for the community. I am currently unemployed, but my hope is that this class will help me get one step closer to a career in cybersecruity or similar. My plan for school is to get my first certificate online through BYU-Pathway, and then finish my Associate's and Bachelor's Degrees on-campus up at BYU-Idaho. But with that out of the way, let me tell you some things about myself.</p>
            <p>Firstly, I am a <strong>huge</strong> fan of anything considered entertainment, particulary movies, tv shows, and video games, which I call the "Holy Trinity". My favorite movie of all time is WALL-E, which I've loved since I was a kid, my favorite TV show is probably Spongebob Squarepants if I could only choose one, and my favorite video game of all time is Burnout Paradise, but my favorite series is Super Mario. Other franchies I'm a big fan of are anything Nintendo, Halo, Star Wars, Batman, Minecraft, Disney, Pixar, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Shrek, etc.</p>
            <p>I'm also a huge car enthusiast, which usally manifests itself in things like racing video games and collecting toy cars, usually Hotwheels. I'm also a casual fan of NASCAR, I can never watch any of the races but I enjoy the aesthetic of the sport. Specific racing games I enjoy playing are Mario Kart, Burnout, and Forza Horizon. My favorite sports car is the Nissan GT-R Nismo, my favorite passenger car is the Toyota Camry, my favorite truck is the Chevrolet Silverado, and my favorite SUV is a toss between the Ford Bronco or the Toyota 4Runner.</p>
            <p>Some of my other hobbies include swimming, taking strolls around my neighborhood, cooking, music, spending time with my family, and writing fiction. In fact, after I can safely call myself a professional in computer science, I would one day like to get a group of co-workers together and start an independent entertainment company. I also like learning about science, in particular biology and astronomy.</p>
            <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my whole life. I have been blessed to be born and raised in a familt where we've been taught to love and support one another. I am very grateful for the privileges I have and the oppurtunity to live with our Heavenly Father and my family for enternity. I'm not sure how strong my testimony is, but I don't think I could deny any of the teachings of the Gospel under any circumstance. It's just not something I can see myself doing.</p>
            <p>All in all, I'm very grateful for the chance to participate in this course with y'all and I'm looking forward to learning about HTML, CSS, and other web development essentials. Thank you for your time, and I hope y'all have an awesome day.</p>

            <h2>Texas</h2>
            <img src="images/texas.jpg" alt="Texas Hill Country">
            <p>This is a picture of one of the many geographical regions of Texas, where I live. Texas, also known as the Lone Star State, is the southernmost state of the United States of America. It's bordered by New Mexico to the west, Oklahoma to the north, Arkansas to the northeast, Louisiana to the east, and by the country of Mexico to the south. There's also the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Because of it's location, Texas inherits a rich diveristy of culture, everything from English, to Hispanic, to African, to Native American. Texas is also known for having the <strong>biggest</strong> state fair in the country, lasting 24 days and honing in around 2.2 million participants annualy. The weather here depends on the region, but I find that the people are perhaps the nicest in the world. Texas is also the home to many big corporations like ExxonMobil, AT&T, Dell Technologies, and the owner of Dr Pepper. There's also H-E-B, which in my opinion is the best state-wide supermarket chain in the country. The Texas State Animals include the Nine-banded Armadillo, the semi-feral Texas Longhorn, the Mexican Free-tailed Bat, the Guadalupe Bass, the Monarch Butterfly, the Horny Toad, and the Lightning Whelk, .All in all, Texas to me seems like a great place to live.</p>
